# Formatting
## Braces
Braces are not required for when branches and if statement bodies which have no else if/else branches and which fit on a single line.

```kotlin
if (string.isEmpty()) return

when (value) {
    0 -> return
    // …
}
```
Braces are otherwise required for any if, for, when branch, do, and while statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.

```kotlin
if (string.isEmpty())
    return  // WRONG!

if (string.isEmpty()) {
    return  // Okay
}
```
### Non-empty blocks
Braces follow the Kernighan and Ritchie style ("Egyptian brackets") for nonempty blocks and block-like constructs:

- No line break before the opening brace.
- Line break after the opening brace.
- Line break before the closing brace.
- Line break after the closing brace, only if that brace terminates a statement or terminates the body of a function, constructor, or named class. For example, there is no line break after the brace if it is followed by else or a comma.

```kotlin
return Runnable {
    while (condition()) {
        foo()
    }
}

return object : MyClass() {
    override fun foo() {
        if (condition()) {
            try {
                something()
            } catch (e: ProblemException) {
                recover()
            }
        } else if (otherCondition()) {
            somethingElse()
        } else {
            lastThing()
        }
    }
}
```
A few exceptions for (enum classes)[http://reference_below] are given below.

### Empty blocks
An empty block or block-like construct must be in K&R style.

```kotlin
try {
    doSomething()
} catch (e: Exception) {} // WRONG!
```
```kotlin
try {
    doSomething()
} catch (e: Exception) {
} // Okay
```

### Expressions
An if/else conditional that is used as an expression may omit braces only if the entire expression fits on one line.

```kotlin
val value = if (string.isEmpty()) 0 else 1  // Okay
val value = if (string.isEmpty())  // WRONG!
                0
            else
                1
```
```kotlin
val value = if (string.isEmpty()) { // Okay
    0
} else {
    1
}
```

### Indentation
Each time a new block or block-like construct is opened, the indent increases by four spaces. When the block ends, the indent returns to the previous indent level. The indent level applies to both code and comments throughout the block.

### One statement per line
Each statement is followed by a line break. Semicolons are not used.

### Line wrapping
Code has a column limit of 100 characters. Except as noted below, any line that would exceed this limit must be line-wrapped, as explained below.

Exceptions:
- Lines where obeying the column limit is not possible (for example, a long URL in KDoc)
- package and import statements
- Command lines in a comment that may be cut-and-pasted into a shell

### Where to break
The prime directive of line-wrapping is: prefer to break at a higher syntactic level. Also:

- When a line is broken at a non-assignment operator the break comes before the symbol.
  - This also applies to the following “operator-like” symbols:
  - The dot separator (`.`).
  - The two colons of a member reference (`::`).
- When a line is broken at an assignment operator the break comes after the symbol.
- A method or constructor name stays attached to the open parenthesis (`(`) that follows it.
- A comma (`,`) stays attached to the token that precedes it.
- A lambda arrow (`->`) stays attached to the argument list that precedes it.

> Note: The primary goal for line wrapping is to have clear code, not necessarily code that fits in the smallest number of lines.

### Continuation indent
When line-wrapping, each line after the first (each **continuation line**) is indented at least +8 from the original line.

When there are multiple continuation lines, indentation may be varied beyond +8 as desired. In general, two continuation lines use the same indentation level if and only if they begin with syntactically parallel elements.

### Functions
When a function signature does not fit on a single line, break each parameter declaration onto its own line. Parameters defined in this format should use a single indent (+4). The closing parenthesis (`)`) and return type are placed on their own line with no additional indent.

```kotlin
fun <T> Iterable<T>.joinToString(
    separator: CharSequence = ", ",
    prefix: CharSequence = "",
    postfix: CharSequence = ""
): String {
    // …
}
```

#### Expression functions
When a function contains only a single expression it can be represented as an expression function.

```kotlin
override fun toString(): String {
    return "Hey"
}
```
```kotlin
override fun toString(): String = "Hey"
```
Expression functions should not wrap to two lines. If an expression function grows to require wrapping, use a normal function body, a `return` declaration, and normal expression wrapping rules instead.

#### Properties
When a property initializer does not fit on a single line, break after the equals sign (`=`) and use a continuation indent.

```kotlin
private val defaultCharset: Charset? =
        EncodingRegistry.getInstance().getDefaultCharsetForPropertiesFiles(file)
```
Properties declaring a `get` and/or `set` function should place each on their own line with a normal indent (+4). Format them using the same rules as functions.

```kotlin
var directory: File? = null
    set(value) {
        // …
    }
```
Read-only properties can use a shorter syntax which fits on a single line.
```kotlin
val defaultExtension: String get() = "kt"
```

## Whitespace
### Vertical
A single blank line appears:

- Between consecutive members of a class: properties, constructors, functions, nested classes, etc.
  - Exception: A blank line between two consecutive properties (having no other code between them) is optional. Such blank lines are used as needed to create logical groupings of properties and associate properties with their backing property, if present.
  - Exception: Blank lines between enum constants are covered below.
- Between statements, as needed to organize the code into logical subsections.
- Optionally before the first statement in a function, before the first member of a class, or after the last member of a class (neither encouraged nor discouraged).
- As required by other sections of this document (such as the Structure section).
Multiple consecutive blank lines are permitted, but not encouraged or ever required.

### Horizontal
Beyond where required by the language or other style rules, and apart from literals, comments, and KDoc, a single ASCII space also appears in the following places only:

- Separating any reserved word, such as `if`, `for`, or `catch` from an open parenthesis (`(`) that follows it on that line.
```kotlin
// WRONG!
for(i in 0..1) {
}
```
```kotlin
// Okay
for (i in 0..1) {
}
```
- Separating any reserved word, such as `else` or `catch`, from a closing curly brace (`}`) that precedes it on that line.
```kotlin
// WRONG!
}else {
}
```
```kotlin
// Okay
} else {
}
```
- Before any open curly brace (`{`).
```kotlin
// WRONG!
if (list.isEmpty()){
}
```
```kotlin
// Okay
if (list.isEmpty()) {
}
```
- On both sides of any binary operator.
```kotlin
// WRONG!
val two = 1+1
```
```kotlin
// Okay
val two = 1 + 1
```
This also applies to the following “operator-like” symbols:
  - the arrow in a lambda expression (`->`).
```kotlin
// WRONG!
ints.map { value->value.toString() }
```
```kotlin
// Okay
ints.map { value -> value.toString() }
```
But not:
  - the two colons (`::`) of a member reference.
```kotlin
// WRONG!
val toString = Any :: toString
```kotlin
```// Okay
val toString = Any::toString
```
  - the dot separator (`.`).
```kotlin
// WRONG
it . toString()
```
```kotlin
// Okay
it.toString()
```
  - the range operator (`..`).
```kotlin
// WRONG
 for (i in 1 .. 4) print(i)
 ```
 ```kotlin
 // Okay
 for (i in 1..4) print(i)
 ```
- Before a colon (`:`) only if used in a class declaration for specifying a base class or interfaces, or when used in a where clause for generic constraints.
```kotlin
// WRONG!
class Foo: Runnable
```
```kotlin
// Okay
class Foo : Runnable
```
```kotlin
// WRONG
fun <T: Comparable> max(a: T, b: T)
```
```kotlin
// Okay
fun <T : Comparable> max(a: T, b: T)
```
```kotlin
// WRONG
fun <T> max(a: T, b: T) where T: Comparable<T>
```
```kotlin
// Okay
fun <T> max(a: T, b: T) where T : Comparable<T>
```
- After a comma (`,`) or colon (`:`).
```kotlin
// WRONG!
val oneAndTwo = listOf(1,2)
```
```kotlin
// Okay
val oneAndTwo = listOf(1, 2)
```
```kotlin
// WRONG!
class Foo :Runnable
```
```kotlin
// Okay
class Foo : Runnable
```
- On both sides of the double slash (`//`) that begins an end-of-line comment. Here, multiple spaces are allowed, but not required.
```kotlin
// WRONG!
var debugging = false//disabled by default
```
```kotlin
// Okay
var debugging = false // disabled by default
```
This rule is never interpreted as requiring or forbidding additional space at the start or end of a line; it addresses only interior space.

## Specific constructs

### Enum classes
An enum with no functions and no documentation on its constants may optionally be formatted as a single line.

```kotlin
enum class Answer { YES, NO, MAYBE }
```
When the constants in an enum are placed on separate lines, a blank line is not required between them except in the case where they define a body.

```kotlin
enum class Answer {
    YES,
    NO,

    MAYBE {
        override fun toString() = """¯\_(ツ)_/¯"""
    }
}
```
Since enum classes are classes, all other rules for formatting classes apply.

### Annotations
Member or type annotations are placed on separate lines immediately prior to the annotated construct.

```kotlin
@Retention(SOURCE)
@Target(FUNCTION, PROPERTY_SETTER, FIELD)
annotation class Global
```
Annotations without arguments can be placed on a single line.
```kotlin
@JvmField @Volatile
var disposable: Disposable? = null
```
When only a single annotation without arguments is present, it may be placed on the same line as the declaration.

```kotlin
@Volatile var disposable: Disposable? = null

@Test fun selectAll() {
    // …
}
```
### Implicit return/property types
If an expression function body or a property initializer is a scalar value or the return type can be clearly inferred from the body then it can be omitted.

```kotlin
override fun toString(): String = "Hey"
// becomes
override fun toString() = "Hey"
```
```kotlin
private val ICON: Icon = IconLoader.getIcon("/icons/kotlin.png")
// becomes
private val ICON = IconLoader.getIcon("/icons/kotlin.png")
```
When writing a library, retain the explicit type declaration when it is part of the public API.

## Naming
Identifiers use only ASCII letters and digits, and, in a small number of cases noted below, underscores. Thus each valid identifier name is matched by the regular expression `\w+`.

Special prefixes or suffixes, like those seen in the examples `name_`, `mName`, `s_name`, and `kName`, are not used except in the case of backing properties (see [Backing properties]()).

### Package Names
Package names are all lowercase, with consecutive words simply concatenated together (no underscores).

```kotlin
// Okay
package com.example.deepspace
// WRONG!
package com.example.deepSpace
// WRONG!
package com.example.deep_space
```

### Type names
Class names are written in PascalCase and are typically nouns or noun phrases. For example, `Character` or `ImmutableList`. Interface names may also be nouns or noun phrases (for example, `List`), but may sometimes be adjectives or adjective phrases instead (for example `Readable`).

Test classes are named starting with the name of the class they are testing, and ending with `Test`. For example, `HashTest` or `HashIntegrationTest`.

### Function names
Function names are written in camelCase and are typically verbs or verb phrases. For example, `sendMessage` or `stop`.

Underscores are permitted to appear in test function names to separate logical components of the name.

```kotlin
@Test fun pop_emptyStack() {
    // …
}
```

### Constant names
Constant names use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE: all uppercase letters, with words separated by underscores. But what is a constant, exactly?

Constants are `val` properties with no custom `get` function, whose contents are deeply immutable, and whose functions have no detectable side-effects. This includes immutable types and immutable collections of immutable types as well as scalars and string if marked as `const`. If any of an instance’s observable state can change, it is not a constant. Merely intending to never mutate the object is not enough.

```kotlin
const val NUMBER = 5
val NAMES = listOf("Alice", "Bob")
val AGES = mapOf("Alice" to 35, "Bob" to 32)
val COMMA_JOINER = Joiner.on(',') // Joiner is immutable
val EMPTY_ARRAY = arrayOf()
```
These names are typically nouns or noun phrases.

Constant values can only be defined inside of an `object` or as a top-level declaration. Values otherwise meeting the requirement of a constant but defined inside of a `class` must use a non-constant name.

Constants which are scalar values must use the `const` modifier.

### Non-constant names
Non-constant names are written in camelCase. These apply to instance properties, local properties, and parameter names.

```kotlin
val variable = "var"
val nonConstScalar = "non-const"
val mutableCollection: MutableSet = HashSet()
val mutableElements = listOf(mutableInstance)
val mutableValues = mapOf("Alice" to mutableInstance, "Bob" to mutableInstance2)
val logger = Logger.getLogger(MyClass::class.java.name)
val nonEmptyArray = arrayOf("these", "can", "change")
```
These names are typically nouns or noun phrases.


#### Backing properties
When a backing property is needed, its name should exactly match that of the real property except prefixed with an underscore.

```kotlin
private var _table: Map? = null

val table: Map
    get() {
        if (_table == null) {
            _table = HashMap()
        }
        return _table ?: throw AssertionError()
    }
```

### Type variable names
Each type variable is named in one of two styles:

- A single capital letter, optionally followed by a single numeral (such as `E`, `T`, `X`, `T2`)
- A name in the form used for classes, followed by the capital letter `T` (such as `RequestT`, `FooBarT`)

### Camel case
Sometimes there is more than one reasonable way to convert an English phrase into camel case, such as when acronyms or unusual constructs like “IPv6” or “iOS” are present. To improve predictability, use the following scheme.

Beginning with the prose form of the name:

1. Convert the phrase to plain ASCII and remove any apostrophes. For example, “Müller’s algorithm” might become “Muellers algorithm”.
2. Divide this result into words, splitting on spaces and any remaining punctuation (typically hyphens). Recommended: if any word already has a conventional camel-case appearance in common usage, split this into its constituent parts (e.g., “AdWords” becomes “ad words”). Note that a word such as “iOS” is not really in camel case per se; it defies any convention, so this recommendation does not apply.
3. Now lowercase everything (including acronyms), then do one of the following:
  - Uppercase the first character of each word to yield pascal case.
  - Uppercase the first character of each word except the first to yield camel case.
4. Finally, join all the words into a single identifier.

Note that the casing of the original words is almost entirely disregarded.

```
Prose form	            Correct	            Incorrect
"XML Http Request"	    XmlHttpRequest	    XMLHTTPRequest
"new customer ID"	    newCustomerId	    newCustomerID
"inner stopwatch"	    innerStopwatch	    innerStopWatch
"supports IPv6 on iOS"	supportsIpv6OnIos	supportsIPv6OnIOS
"YouTube importer"	    YouTubeImporter	    YouTubeImporter*
```
(* Acceptable, but not recommended.)

> **Note:** Some words are ambiguously hyphenated in the English language: for example “nonempty” and “non-empty” are both correct, so the method names **checkNonempty** and **checkNonEmpty** are likewise both correct.

## Documentation
### Formatting
The basic formatting of KDoc blocks is seen in this example:
```kotlin
/**
 * Multiple lines of KDoc text are written here,
 * wrapped normally…
 */
fun method(arg: String) {
    // …
}
```
...or in this single-line example:

```kotlin
/** An especially short bit of KDoc. */
```
The basic form is always acceptable. The single-line form may be substituted when the entirety of the KDoc block (including comment markers) can fit on a single line. Note that this only applies when there are no block tags such as `@return`.

#### Paragraphs
One blank line—that is, a line containing only the aligned leading asterisk (`*`)—appears between paragraphs, and before the group of block tags if present.

#### Block tags
Any of the standard “block tags” that are used appear in the order `@constructor`, `@receiver`, `@param`, `@property`, `@return`, `@throws`, `@see`, and these never appear with an empty description. When a block tag doesn’t fit on a single line, continuation lines are indented 8 spaces from the position of the `@`.

### Summary fragment
Each KDoc block begins with a brief summary fragment. This fragment is very important: it is the only part of the text that appears in certain contexts such as class and method indexes.

This is a fragment–a noun phrase or verb phrase, not a complete sentence. It does not begin with "```A `Foo` is a...```", or "```This method returns...```", nor does it have to form a complete imperative sentence like "Save the record.". However, the fragment is capitalized and punctuated as if it were a complete sentence.

### Usage
At the minimum, KDoc is present for every public type, and every public or protected member of such a type, with a few exceptions noted below.

#### Exception: Self-explanatory functions
KDoc is optional for “simple, obvious” functions like `getFoo` and properties like `foo`, in cases where there really and truly is nothing else worthwhile to say but “Returns the foo”.

It is not appropriate to cite this exception to justify omitting relevant information that a typical reader might need to know. For example, for a function named `getCanonicalName` or property named `canonicalName`, don’t omit its documentation (with the rationale that it would say only `/** Returns the canonical name. */`) if a typical reader may have no idea what the term "canonical name" means!

#### Exception: overrides
KDoc is not always present on a method that overrides a supertype method.
